Steps to compile and run:

Open the folder A3 in visual studio code. Then type these in terminal:

npm install
npm init -y
(if you don't have postgre module in Node, type: npm install pg)
node .\databasepg.js

And it will display and show all the functionalities. BTW, you need to change the value of deleteStudent(15) in line 60 to deleteStudent(16) or deleteStudent(17) to make it work, as student#15 no longer exists.
